# Structured Page Curation Editor — Design

**Status:** Shipped 2026-06-09 — Parts A + B implemented; Phase 6 ITs green (full unit reactor + the affected REST/custom-jdbc IT modules pass). Note: field-value validations (cluster-slug, date, non-canonical type/status, audience) ship as **advisory WARNINGS**, not blocking errors — the corpus has non-kebab clusters, non-ISO dates, and list/pipe audiences, so only malformed YAML blocks a save. The KG curation endpoints are mounted at `/api/page-knowledge/*` (not `/api/pages/{name}/knowledge`).
**Author:** Jake Fear + Claude Code (brainstorming session)

**Goal:** Turn page curation from a source of silent breakage into a guided experience. Two surfaces in one editor: (A) a structured, constraint‑guided **frontmatter** form replacing raw‑YAML authoring, and (B) a page‑scoped **Knowledge‑Graph** panel for confirming/curating the entities and relations mentioned on the page — both with a raw/break‑glass escape hatch where relevant, and both keeping the Markdown body editing untouched.

**Architecture in one breath:** A single server‑authoritative *frontmatter schema* becomes the one source of field rules; a schema‑driven validator enforces them on every save path (REST, MCP, provider) and returns *field‑addressable* violations. The KG panel reads a new page‑scoped slice and writes through the existing `KgCurationOps` facade (SHACL gate + provenance + audit). The React editor's structured region carries two tabs (**Frontmatter | Knowledge**) above a body‑only CodeMirror; both tabs render from server data and surface the server's violations inline, never enforcing locally.

**Tech stack:** Java 21 / `wikantik-api` + `wikantik-main` + `wikantik-rest` + `wikantik-admin-mcp`; React + Vite (`wikantik-frontend`, CodeMirror 6); SnakeYAML (`FrontmatterParser`/`FrontmatterWriter`); Apache Jena (existing ontology layer).

## 0. Scope — which ontology layers this touches (and which it doesn't)

The `wikantik:` ontology has three layers. This work covers two of them, partially. Stating it plainly so the design isn't oversold:

- **Layer 1 — T‑Box (the vocabulary itself):** the entity/content classes, the 21 KG predicates, their `rdfs:domain`/`rdfs:range`, the schema.org/SKOS/DC/PROV mappings, and the SHACL shapes. Lives in `wikantik.ttl` + `shapes.ttl` + `EntityTypeVocabulary`/`RelationshipTypeVocabulary`/`NodeTypeMapping` (code/Turtle). **Out of scope.** Editing the vocabulary stays a developer task; this editor only creates *instances that conform to* it.
- **Layer 2 — page‑concept A‑Box (frontmatter):** a page's `wk:` content class, its IRI, `dct:title`/`dct:description`, its tag/cluster SKOS concepts, and provenance — all sourced from frontmatter (`PageProjector` + `ConceptProjector`). **Part A** of this design.
- **Layer 3 — Knowledge‑Graph A‑Box (entities + typed relations):** the `kg_nodes`/`kg_edges` instances of the 9 classes and 21 predicates, LLM‑extracted then curated (`EntityProjector` + `EdgeProjector`, fed from the DB). **Part B** adds a *page‑scoped* curation slice inside the editor; **global** entity/edge management stays at `/admin/knowledge-graph/*`.

So "evolve the ontology under shared human/AI control" means, precisely: humans and agents both create and curate **conforming instances** — Layer‑2 page concepts (Part A) and Layer‑3 entities/relations (Part B) — through surfaces that read the same schema and the same SHACL rules. It does **not** mean editing the Layer‑1 vocabulary, which remains code/Turtle.

---

# Part A — Frontmatter (Layer 2)

## 1. Context — what exists today

- **Editor:** `wikantik-frontend/src/components/PageEditor.jsx` (CodeMirror 6 via `CodeEditor.jsx`). Frontmatter is edited as raw YAML text inline at the top of the body. On load the editor calls `reconstructContent(metadata, body)` to splice the metadata object back into a `---` block; on save it sends the whole spliced string as `content`.
- **API already separates metadata from body:** `GET /api/pages/{name}` returns `{ metadata: {...}, content: <body‑only> }`. `PUT /api/pages/{name}` accepts `{ content, metadata, … }` (the `metadata` field is currently unused by the editor). `PATCH /api/pages/{name}` accepts `{ metadata, action }`.
- **No central machine‑readable schema.** Field rules are scattered across `preSave` `PageFilter`s:
  - `FrontmatterValidationPageFilter` — strict YAML parse; throws an opaque `FilterException` *string*.
  - `StructuralSpinePageFilter` — auto‑mints a ULID `canonical_id` (reuses the slug‑bound id).
  - `RunbookValidationPageFilter` / `FrontmatterRunbookValidator` — the nested `runbook:` block shape.
  - Conventions (type/status/cluster/SEO) live only in the `wiki-content` skill doc.
- **No reusable form primitives** in `src/components/ui/` (Badge, Card, Chip, Modal, Spinner, Toast, etc. exist — but no Select, Combobox, TagInput, or Tabs).
- **Corpus reality (≈1.8K pages):** `type` and `status` are *not closed sets* in practice. Canonical `type` values dominate (`article` 1546, `hub` 179, `reference` 22, `runbook` 18, `design` 6) but a long tail exists (`report`, `intelligence`, `blueprint`, `explainer`, `concept`, …). `status` is similar (`active` 1068, plus `published`, `official`, `deployed`, `ongoing`, …). A hard‑closed enum would break saves on ~150+ legacy pages.

## 2. Decisions (locked during brainstorming)

1. **Schema authority:** server‑authoritative. One schema is the single source of field rules.
2. **Schema role:** the schema *drives* validation (focused refactor). A schema‑driven validator enforces the simple field constraints on every save path. Procedural logic stays dedicated: `StructuralSpinePageFilter` (ULID mint) and the nested `runbook:` validator (whose issues are funneled through the same violation channel).
3. **Editing model:** frontmatter leaves CodeMirror. Body editor becomes body‑only; the parsed metadata *object* is canonical in the editor; a Raw‑YAML toggle is the break‑glass; unknown/odd keys are preserved in an Advanced area.
4. **Field scope:** full structured coverage — all *authored* fields get widgets, including the nested `runbook:` editor. (`verification` is **not** nested — see §3.)
5. **Validation UX:** server‑only enforcement; the client never blocks locally. The form renders *advisory* hints from the schema descriptor, always attempts the save, and maps the server's returned violations back to the offending widgets. Because only the server enforces, client and server cannot disagree.
6. **Curated‑open enums with stern, actionable, transitional warnings** (§4.2).

## 3. Field inventory (authored vs. derived)

Authored fields get widgets. Derived fields render read‑only. Anything not in this table round‑trips verbatim through the Advanced key/value area.

| key              | widget              | constraints                                                                  | default severity of violation                                  | notes                                                   |

**Severity rule of thumb:** structurally malformed values (slug regex, date, audience membership, unparseable YAML) are **errors** (block the write); soft / style / governance issues (non‑canonical enum, summary length, unresolved `related`, untrusted `verified_by`, non‑kebab tags) are **warnings** (write proceeds, advisory returned).

### 3.1 `runbook:` nested block (unchanged from `FrontmatterRunbookValidator`)

A map with list‑valued fields, validated when `type: runbook`:

- `when_to_use` — list<string>, **≥1** entry.
- `inputs` — list<string>, optional.
- `steps` — list<string>, **≥2** entries.
- `pitfalls` — list<string>, **≥1** (use `"(none known)"` if truly none).
- `related_tools` — list<string>, each matches `^/(api|knowledge-mcp|wikantik-admin-mcp|tools)/.+$` **or** a bare snake_case tool name `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$`.
- `references` — list<string>, each must resolve to a `canonical_id` **or** a page title.

The `RunbookBlockEditor` widget renders one list editor per field with these constraints as inline hints. The existing `FrontmatterRunbookValidator` remains the authority; its `Issue`s are adapted to `FieldViolation`s with `field` paths like `runbook.steps`, `runbook.pitfalls`, `runbook.references`.

## 4. Server design

### 4.1 The schema model (`wikantik-api`, package `com.wikantik.api.frontmatter.schema`)

- `Severity` — enum `{ ERROR, WARNING }`.
- `FieldViolation` — record `(String field, Severity severity, String code, String message, String suggestion)`. `field` is dotted for nesting (`runbook.steps`); `suggestion` is nullable (a proposed canonical replacement when one exists).
- `FieldSpec` — record describing one field: `key`, `label`, `widget` (enum: `TEXT, TEXTAREA, ENUM, TAGS, PAGE_REFS, DATE, DATETIME, TRISTATE, RUNBOOK_BLOCK, READONLY`), `canonicalValues` (list, for enums), `open` (boolean — open vs. closed enum), `minLen`/`maxLen`, `pattern` (regex), item‑level constraints for lists, and a `suggestionMap` (legacy→canonical) used to populate `FieldViolation.suggestion`.
- `FrontmatterSchema` — ordered `List<FieldSpec>` + factory `FrontmatterSchema.defaultSchema()` that encodes the §3 table in code (no admin UI in v1). One place to change as the page‑concept vocabulary evolves.

### 4.2 Curated‑open enums (the governance lever)

`type` and `status` are **open** enums: the schema lists the canonical values (offered first in the UI), but a non‑canonical value does **not** block. Instead it yields a **stern, actionable warning** that:

- names the value as non‑canonical and lists the canonical set, and
- carries a `suggestion` (canonical replacement) drawn from the field's `suggestionMap` when a mapping exists — so the **form offers one‑click "change to `active`"** and **agents reading the MCP text can self‑correct**.

Example message:

> `status: "published"` is not a canonical status. Canonical values are: draft, active, archived. This value is tolerated for now but will be rejected once the corpus is normalized. Suggested replacement: `active`.

Initial `suggestionMap`s (curator‑tunable, defined in `defaultSchema()`):

- `status`: `published→active, official→active, deployed→active, production→active, ongoing→active, designed→draft, proposed→draft, in_progress→draft`.
- `type`: `report→article, intelligence→article, explainer→article, blueprint→design, implementation→design, concept→reference`.
- Values with no mapping still warn (sternly, with the canonical list) but carry no `suggestion`.

**Transitional escalation.** A property `wikantik.frontmatter.enum.nonCanonical.severity` (default `warning`) flips non‑canonical enum violations to `ERROR` once the corpus is normalized — at which point editing a drifted page is blocked until corrected. The canonical lists themselves live only in `defaultSchema()`, so a curator promotes a new value to canonical by editing that one source.

### 4.3 The validator (`wikantik-main`, `com.wikantik.frontmatter.schema.SchemaDrivenFrontmatterValidator`)

Pure function: `validate(Map<String,Object> metadata, ValidationCtx ctx) → List<FieldViolation>`, where `ValidationCtx` supplies the predicates the rules need without dragging in heavy services (`Predicate<String> pageResolves`, `Predicate<String> clusterExists`, `Predicate<String> isTrustedAuthor`, the non‑canonical severity setting). For the `runbook:` field it **delegates** to the existing `FrontmatterRunbookValidator` and adapts its `Issue`s into `FieldViolation`s. Strict‑YAML parse failures (today's `FrontmatterValidationPageFilter`) are mapped to a single `FieldViolation` on a synthetic `__yaml__` field carrying line/column.

### 4.4 Save pipeline wiring

A new `SchemaValidationPageFilter` (preSave) runs the validator after `StructuralSpinePageFilter` (so `canonical_id` is present). It *adds* schema‑driven field validation, which the codebase has nowhere today. The strict‑YAML‑parse responsibility currently in `FrontmatterValidationPageFilter` is folded into the validator (parse‑then‑validate, surfacing a `__yaml__` violation with line/column), so that filter is retired in favor of the new one. Behavior:

- Any `ERROR`‑severity violation → throw a structured `FrontmatterValidationException` (carrying `List<FieldViolation>`); the page is **not** written.
- `WARNING`‑severity violations → attach to the `Context` (a request‑scoped sink) so the REST layer can return them on the successful response; the page **is** written.

### 4.5 Endpoints & error contract (`wikantik-rest`)

- **`GET /api/frontmatter-schema`** → the descriptor as JSON (field order, widgets, canonical values, `open` flags, constraints, labels). Cacheable; same read visibility as page reads. Drives the form.
- **`POST /api/frontmatter/validate`** → body `{ "frontmatter": "<raw YAML>" }` or `{ "metadata": {…} }`; parses with SnakeYAML (the *one* YAML implementation) + runs the validator; returns `{ "metadata": {…}, "violations": [ … ] }` **without saving**. Powers Raw→Form sync (authoritative parse, no divergent client YAML parser) and optional pre‑save warning preview.
- **`PUT /api/pages/{name}`** (modified):
  - error violations → **HTTP 422** `{ "error": "frontmatter_validation_failed", "violations": [ … ] }`; page not written.
  - success with warnings → **HTTP 200** `{ "ok": true, "version": N, "warnings": [ … ] }`; page written.
  - A JAX‑RS `ExceptionMapper` for `FrontmatterValidationException` produces the 422 body.

`FieldViolation` JSON shape (errors and warnings share it; the KG panel in Part B reuses it):

```json
{ "field": "cluster", "severity": "error", "code": "cluster.slug.malformed",
  "message": "cluster 'Interval Trees' is not a valid slug — use lowercase kebab-case, e.g. 'interval-trees'",
  "suggestion": "interval-trees" }
```

### 4.6 MCP parity (`wikantik-admin-mcp`)

The write tools (`write_page`/`update_page`/batch variants) already pre‑normalize via `FrontmatterNormalizer`. They additionally run `SchemaDrivenFrontmatterValidator`:

- error violations → the tool **refuses**, citing the violations as text (same `message` + `suggestion` strings the form shows) so an agent can fix and retry.
- warning violations → included in the tool result text (stern hint + suggestion) but the write proceeds.

Both faces (form + MCP) read the same schema and receive the same actionable, suggestion‑bearing messages — so humans and agents curate the **page‑concept layer** (§0, Layer 2) under one set of rules. This is the Layer‑2 half of "shared control"; the Layer‑3 half is Part B.

## 5. Frontend design (`wikantik-frontend`)

### 5.1 New shared UI primitives (`src/components/ui/`)

`Select.jsx`, `Combobox.jsx` (search‑backed, async option source), `TagInput.jsx` (chips reusing the existing `Chip` + autocomplete), `Tabs.jsx`. Each with matching CSS and vitest tests. These are net‑new reusable primitives (extending the existing `ui/` layer, per the project's "reuse `ui/` before re‑rolling" rule); the Knowledge panel (Part B) reuses `Select` and `Tabs`.

### 5.2 The frontmatter surface (`src/components/frontmatter/`)

- `schemaClient.js` — fetches and caches `GET /api/frontmatter-schema`.
- `FrontmatterEditor.jsx` — the Frontmatter tab. Owns the metadata **object** state. Renders **Form ⇄ Raw YAML** sub‑tabs and an **Advanced** disclosure. Maps each schema `FieldSpec` to a field component; renders read‑only chips for `canonical_id` / `confidence` / `agent_hints`; routes unknown keys to the Advanced `KeyValueEditor`. Accepts a `violations` prop (from the last save / dry‑run) and shows them inline on the matching widget (error styling vs. advisory), with a one‑click "apply suggestion" affordance when `suggestion` is present.
- `fields/` — `EnumField`, `TagsField`, `PageRefsField`, `SummaryField` (counter), `DateField`, `AudienceField`, `KgIncludeField`, `RunbookBlockEditor`, `ReadOnlyField`, `KeyValueEditor`.

### 5.3 Editing model & round‑trip

- **Load:** `GET /api/pages/{name}` → metadata object into `FrontmatterEditor`, body into CodeMirror. `reconstructContent` is no longer used in the editor path; the body editor never sees the `---` block.
- **Save (Form mode):** send `{ content: <body>, metadata: <object> }`. The **server composes** the frontmatter (existing `FrontmatterWriter`) and runs the full preSave pipeline — so there is no client‑side YAML serializer to drift, and every existing filter still applies.
- **Break‑glass (Raw mode):** a YAML textarea (CodeMirror `lang-yaml` for highlighting). Switching Form→Raw serializes the current object to YAML for display (client `metadataToYaml`, display‑only). Switching Raw→Form calls `POST /api/frontmatter/validate` to parse authoritatively; on success the returned `metadata` repopulates the form, on parse error the Raw view stays authoritative and shows line/column. Saving in Raw mode sends the composed text in `content` (no `metadata`), letting the server parse and validate as the single authority.
- **Fidelity:** the body is always untouched. In Form mode, YAML comments / key order are not preserved (acceptable — that is precisely what break‑glass covers). Unknown keys are always preserved via the Advanced area.

### 5.4 Validation UX (server‑only enforcement)

The form always attempts the save. On **422** it maps `violations` to widgets inline (must‑fix) and shows a summary; on **200 with warnings** it surfaces them inline as advisory (already saved). Live, purely cosmetic hints (e.g. the summary counter color, enum "non‑canonical" badge) are derived from the descriptor for instant feedback but carry no authority — the authoritative warnings always come from the server response. Optionally the editor may call `POST /api/frontmatter/validate` on idle to preview warnings before saving (nice‑to‑have, not required for v1).

### 5.5 New‑page flow

`NewArticleModal.jsx` slims to "page name + starting type". On create it routes into the editor with an empty body and a **seeded metadata object** (type, status=`active`, date=today); the structured `FrontmatterEditor` takes over. The modal's current ad‑hoc raw‑YAML string building is retired.

## 6. Data flow (Part A)

```
LOAD:   GET /api/pages/{name}  ->  { metadata, content(body) }
            metadata --> FrontmatterEditor (object, canonical)
            content  --> CodeMirror (body only)

SAVE (form):  PUT /api/pages/{name}  { content: body, metadata: object }
            server: FrontmatterWriter(metadata)+body
                    -> StructuralSpinePageFilter (mint canonical_id)
                    -> SchemaValidationPageFilter (SchemaDrivenFrontmatterValidator)
                         errors  -> 422 { violations }      (not written)
                         warnings-> attach to context        (written)
                    -> 200 { ok, version, warnings }
            form: map violations/warnings -> widgets (inline, with suggestions)

SAVE (raw):   PUT { content: <full text incl ---> }   (server parses + validates)

SYNC raw->form / preview:  POST /api/frontmatter/validate { frontmatter | metadata }
                           -> { metadata, violations }   (no write)
```

## 7. Error handling (Part A)

- Malformed YAML in Raw mode → server returns a `__yaml__` violation with line/column; the form keeps Raw authoritative and pins the message.
- Network / 5xx on save → existing toast error path; the editor state is retained (no data loss).
- A field the schema doesn't know → never an error; it lands in Advanced and is written verbatim.
- The validator and every filter log at least `WARN` with context on any swallowed/degraded path (per project rule — no empty catches).

# Part B — Page‑scoped Knowledge‑Graph panel (Layer‑3 slice)

## 8. Governance, blast radius & data model

### 8.1 Governance & blast radius

- **Reads** are page‑scoped and **view‑ACL‑gated** (the same view permission as reading the page).
- **Writes** are **page‑edit‑gated** (the same permission required to edit the page) and route through the existing `KgCurationOps` facade — so the SHACL write‑time gate (Phase 5b), `HUMAN_CURATED` provenance stamping, and the tamper‑evident `/admin/audit` log all apply identically to the admin path. No new curation logic; only a new permission‑scoped entry point.
- **Blast radius is explicit:** entities/edges are **global** (shared across pages). Editing an entity's `nodeType`, or adding an edge, is a global mutation initiated from a page context — not a page‑local change. Mitigations: provenance stamping, the audit log, and the existing `/admin/knowledge-graph/*` oversight views. A proposal/review flow and entity merge are **out of v1** (§12).

### 8.2 Data model & the read gap

Today there is **no** "entities for this page" query. The data path exists — `kg_content_chunks.page_name → chunk_entity_mentions(node_id) → kg_nodes` — but nothing wraps it. New work:

- `KnowledgeGraphService.getPageSlice(pageName)` (new service method + supporting DAO query) returns:
  - `entities`: the `KgNode`s mentioned on the page (via that chain), each projected to `{ id, name, nodeType, provenance, status (from `properties`), isStub }`.
  - `edges`: the `KgEdge`s whose **both** endpoints are in that entity set (intra‑page relations), endpoint names resolved via `getNodeNames`, each `{ id, sourceId, targetId, sourceName, targetName, relationshipType, provenance }`.
- Cross‑page neighbor entities/edges (one endpoint off‑page) are a fast‑follow (§12).

Reference shapes already in `wikantik-api`: `KgNode(id, name, nodeType, sourcePage, provenance, properties, …)`, `KgEdge(id, sourceId, targetId, relationshipType, provenance, properties, …)`; `Provenance` ∈ `{HUMAN_AUTHORED, HUMAN_CURATED, AI_INFERRED, AI_REVIEWED}`.

## 9. Endpoints (`wikantik-rest`, new `PageKnowledgeResource`)

- **`GET /api/pages/{name}/knowledge`** → `{ entities, edges }` (§8.2). Gated by **page view** permission (`RestServletBase.checkPagePermission(view)`).
- Writes — all gated by **page edit** permission, all routed through `KgCurationOps`:
  - `POST /api/pages/{name}/knowledge/entities` `{ name, nodeType, properties? }` → `tryUpsertNode(name, nodeType, sourcePage=this page, …)` — add an entity or change its type.
  - `POST /api/pages/{name}/knowledge/entities/{id}/confirm` → re‑upsert stamping `HUMAN_CURATED` (promote an `AI_INFERRED` node).
  - `DELETE /api/pages/{name}/knowledge/entities/{id}` → `tryDeleteNode`.
  - `POST /api/pages/{name}/knowledge/edges` `{ sourceId, targetId, relationshipType, properties? }` → `tryUpsertEdge`. On `EdgeResult.fail(reason)` (SHACL refusal or the page/entity boundary guard) → **HTTP 422** `{ "violations": [{ "field": "edge", "severity": "error", "code": "kg.edge.refused", "message": <reason> }] }` — the same envelope and `FieldViolation` shape as §4.5.
  - `POST /api/pages/{name}/knowledge/edges/{id}/confirm` → `tryConfirmEdge`.
  - `DELETE /api/pages/{name}/knowledge/edges/{id}` → `tryDeleteEdge`; `POST /api/pages/{name}/knowledge/edges/{id}/reject` → `tryDeleteAndRejectEdge` (with reason).

No new curation REST surface is invented — these are thin, page‑permission‑scoped wrappers over the same `KgCurationOps` methods the admin endpoints and MCP tools already use.

## 10. Frontend (`wikantik-frontend`)

- The editor's structured region carries top‑level **Frontmatter | Knowledge** tabs (using the new `Tabs` primitive); the body editor (CodeMirror) stays visible below regardless of the active tab. `FrontmatterEditor` (Part A) is the Frontmatter tab.
- `frontmatter/` gains nothing here; a new `knowledge/KnowledgeGraphPanel.jsx` renders the page slice:
  - **Entities** list — name, a `nodeType` `Select` over the 9 `EntityTypeVocabulary` classes, a provenance badge, and confirm/remove controls; plus an "add entity" row.
  - **Relations (intra‑page)** list — `src → predicate → tgt` with a remove control; plus an "add relation" row: two entity pickers + a predicate `Select` over the 21 `RelationshipTypeVocabulary` values. **All 21 predicates are offered**; a non‑conformant choice is **refused by the server's SHACL gate** and shown inline (422 → field‑style message) — consistent with Part A's server‑only‑enforcement model.
- `client.js` gains `getPageKnowledge` / `upsertEntity` / `confirmEntity` / `deleteEntity` / `upsertEdge` / `confirmEdge` / `deleteEdge`.
- The panel reflects **committed** KG state; editing the body does not live‑re‑extract. A "re‑extract this page" action is a fast‑follow (§12).

# Cross‑cutting

## 11. Testing strategy

**Part A — Java (unit):**

- `FrontmatterSchema.defaultSchema()` shape; `SchemaDrivenFrontmatterValidator` per rule class — open vs. closed enums, summary length, slug regex, date/datetime, audience membership, tags kebab, `related` resolution, `verified_by` trust; severity assignment; `suggestion` population from `suggestionMap`; non‑canonical severity escalation via the property.
- Runbook delegation: `FrontmatterRunbookValidator` `Issue`s adapt to `FieldViolation`s with correct `field` paths.
- **Drift guard:** schema `type` canonical set ⊇ `NodeTypeMapping` page‑type keys; keeps the form's vocabulary tied to the ontology mapping (mirrors `EntityTypeVocabularyDriftTest`).

**Part A — REST IT:** the 422 contract (error violations, page not written), the 200‑with‑warnings contract (page written), `GET /api/frontmatter-schema`, `POST /api/frontmatter/validate`. **MCP IT:** write tool refuses on error violations citing them, and includes warnings on success (per the "MCP write‑surface needs unit + wire‑level IT" project rule).

**Part A — frontend (vitest):** each new `ui/` primitive; each field widget (renders from descriptor, emits object changes, shows inline violation + applies suggestion); round‑trip fidelity (load→edit→save preserves unknown keys); Form⇄Raw sync incl. invalid‑YAML; 422→inline mapping. *(Mind the known vitest concurrency flakiness — re‑run a file in isolation before chasing a failure.)*

**Part B — Java:** `getPageSlice` DAO/service unit (the mention‑chain join + intra‑page edge filter); `PageKnowledgeResource` permission gating (view→read, edit→write) and the SHACL‑refusal→422 path (REST IT, again pairing a unit test with a wire‑level IT per project rule).

**Part B — frontend (vitest):** `KnowledgeGraphPanel` renders the slice, edits a `nodeType`, adds/removes a relation, shows a SHACL refusal inline.

**IT (Selenide):** Part A — open a seeded page, edit a field via the form, save, verify persisted; break‑glass round‑trip; non‑canonical enum shows the stern warning + one‑click suggestion. Part B — open a page with a known seeded entity, confirm it, add an intra‑page relation, and see a non‑conformant predicate refused. *(Use startup fixtures, not freshly‑seeded pages, per the structural‑index seed‑lag note.)*

## 12. Scope boundaries (YAGNI) & fast‑follows

**In v1:** Part A (schema + validator + 3 endpoints + the structured surface with all authored‑field widgets + Advanced passthrough + Raw break‑glass + MCP parity + curated‑open enums with stern suggestions + escalation property) **and** Part B (page‑scoped read + page‑edit‑gated curation of entities and intra‑page relations through `KgCurationOps`, SHACL‑gated, with the Frontmatter|Knowledge tabbed surface).

**Explicitly out (fast‑follows):**

- **Curator schema‑admin UI** — v1 edits the schema in `defaultSchema()` code/config. A UI to manage canonical sets / suggestion maps is a later phase.
- **Bulk re‑typing / corpus normalization sweep** — the suggestions make per‑page fixes easy; a batch "normalize all non‑canonical" job is separate.
- **YAML comment / key‑order preservation in Form mode** — break‑glass covers it.
- **Live pre‑save warning preview** — optional polish on top of `POST /api/frontmatter/validate`.
- **KG: merge duplicate entities** (global/admin), the **proposal/review flow** for curation, **cross‑page neighbor** browsing, **re‑extract‑this‑page**, and a **domain/range‑aware predicate filter** (v1 offers all 21 and lets the SHACL gate refuse; a Jena‑backed pre‑filter is later).
- **Layer‑1 vocabulary editing** (the T‑Box: entity/content classes, the 21 predicates, domain/range, SHACL shapes) — stays code/Turtle; explicitly never in this editor (§0).

## 13. Open items resolved during brainstorming

- `verification` is **two flat authored fields** (`verified_at`, `verified_by`) plus the authored enum `audience` (`{humans, agents, both}`) — **not** a nested block. `confidence` is derived (read‑only).
- Enums are **curated‑open**: non‑canonical values warn (sternly, with a suggested canonical replacement) rather than block, to avoid breaking ~150 legacy pages; escalatable to error via `wikantik.frontmatter.enum.nonCanonical.severity` once normalized.
- **Page→entity linkage** uses the `kg_content_chunks → chunk_entity_mentions → kg_nodes` chain; no by‑page entity/edge query existed before this work, so `getPageSlice` + `GET /api/pages/{name}/knowledge` are net‑new.
- **KG curation governance:** page‑edit‑gated **direct** writes through `KgCurationOps` (not admin‑only, not proposal‑based) — chosen for the most direct shared human/AI control, with provenance + audit + SHACL as the guardrails.
